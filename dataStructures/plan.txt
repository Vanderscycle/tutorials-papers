a .md tutorial on all data structure with a practical example using python (creation of classes) on all of them
To do:
- B tree
- b+ tree
- IASM
- Doubly linked list
- hash tables (linear search or open addressing/ chaining or closed addressing)

When one data structure is ready we want to make it interactive and see the changes it undergoes as the user types data
