My interpretation of data structures based on [freeCodeCamp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM).

Dockerized version available of the data structure CLI app available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vandercycle/datastructures-python/general)

to run the container enter the following commands in the CLI:
```bash
docker run -it data_structure_app:beta-pre-prod /bin/bash
cd demonstrations/
bash start.sh
```
