** S3 (Object Storage)
+ [[Table of Content]]
*** Intro
S3 stands for Simple Storage Services
Typically suitable for very large volumes of static data—especially unstructured data. Objects contains your data, they are like files (images, CVS, etc) ranging from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
An S3 Bucket contains all of the objects.

*** Storage Classes
In order of costs and availability:
- S3 Standard
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- S3 Standard-IA (infrequent access)
  Recomended if you access the files less than once a month (retrival fees otherwise)
- S3 One Zone-IA
  Same a above but objects only exists in a single [[https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/][availability zone]] so reduced durability
- Glacier
  For data that is maybe used 1-2 a year
- Glacier Deep Archive
  Retrival times of 12 hours (stored on magnetic tape) recommended for data records (7-10 years)

*** Security
**** S3 policies
S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied for which principals on the bucket that the bucket policy is attached to (e.g. allow user Alice to PUT but not DELETE objects in the bucket). TLDR Control access in S3 environment
#+begin_src json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Alice",
                "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"]
      },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
#+end_src

**** S3 Access Control Lists
S3 ACLs is a legacy access control mechanism that predates IAM. An S3 ACL is a sub-resource that’s attached to every S3 bucket and object. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. When you create a bucket or an object, Amazon S3 creates a default ACL that grants the resource owner full control over the resource.

**** S3 permissions
The following example bucket policy grants the s3:PutObject and the s3:PutObjectAcl permissions to a user (Dave). If you remove the Principal element, you can attach the policy to a user.
#+begin_src json options
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::12345678901:user/Dave"
            },
            "Action": [
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket1/*"
        }
    ]
}
#+end_src json
The following policy, when attached to a role/user allows full access to all s3 bucket in the account. If you need to access another account use `sts:AssumeRole`
#+begin_src json options
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "s3-object-lambda:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::{number}:role/{role-name}"
        }
    ]
}

*** S3 Encryption
Uses AES-256 by default
- Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
- Server side encryption (SSE)
  * SSE-AES: S3 handles the key and uses AES-256
- Client side encryption

*** S3 Data Consistency
- New Objects (puts)
new S3 Objects can be read immediately after writting
- Overwrte (PUTS)/Delete Objects (DELETE)
  When you overwrite or delete an object it takes time for S3 to replicate versions to AZs

*** S3 Cross Region Replication (CRR)
Any Object will be automatically replicated to another region.
Must be enabled alongside versioning for both the source and destination. Works for multi-account.

*** S3 Versioning
Store all versions of an object in S3 ( cannot be disabled once activated ) kinda like Git
Every new object uploaded will be given a hversion ID unless versioning was off when they existed prior versioning

*** S3 Lifecycle Management
Automate the process of moving objects to different storage classes. Can be used with versioning. Usefull when data must be kept for record keeping.

*** S3 Transfer Acceleration
To transfer large files over long distances, users uses a distinct URL for an Edge location. Using AWS Backbone Network the edge location transfers to the S3 bucket.

*** S3 Presigned Urls
Generates a url which provides you temporary access to an object to either upload or download object data
`aws s3 presing s3://mybucket/myobject --expires-in 300`

*** S3 MFA delete
Multi Factor Authentification (MFA) which prevents users from deleting objects unless they provided their MFA code. Requires the following:
- AWS CLI must be used
- the bucket must have versioning turned on
#+begin_src bash options
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
--bucket bucketname \
--versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled \
--mfa "your mfa serical number "
#+end_src bash
Only the bucket owner can DELETE
*** TODO Monitoring (clouflair)
*** TODO Terraform
*** Misc
If Public and versioning is enabled, any new files version of an object will be set to private

*** S3 Follow along

** Snowball
+ [[Table of Content]]
Petabyte transfer service (move data to AWS using a briefcase computer)
Essentially instead of transfering 50TB+ data over high speed internet we do so using that briefcase.
*** Snowball edge
Same with snowball but more storage and compute power (100TB) and can act as edge nodes. Can be clustered and specialized for storage/compute/GPU optimized
*** Snowmobile
Essentially AWS ships you a massive container w/ 100 PB

** Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
+ [[Table of Content]]
Can be thought as your own personal data centre
#+attr_html: :alt  :align left :class img :width 500px
[[./images/aws-vpc.png][vpc general overview]]
*** Key features
VPC are region specific and you can have up to 5 per region
a maximum of 200 subnets per VPC are possible

*** About CIDR
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks are for specifying a range to IP addresses in format of IPv4 or IPv6
x, y, z and t are numbers from 0 to 255. Basically, each represents an 8 bit binary number. That's why it is range is up to 255. Combination of this numbers becomes an IPv4 IP address that must be unique to be able to identify a specific instance.

In case of AWS, p is a number from 16 to 28. It represents the number of bits that are inherited from given IP address. For example: 10.0.0.0/16 represents an IP address in following format: 10.0.x.y where x and y are any number from 0 to 255. So, actually it represents a range of IP addresses, starting from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255.

A CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16 refers to all IP addresses that start with 10.0.x.x.

*** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

*** Default VPC
AWS has a default VPC in every region
Creates the following:
- Internet Gateway
- Default Security Group
- Default Network Access Control List (NACL)
- Associated default DHCP

*** VPC peering
Connects one VPC to another so that they behave like they are on the same network. You can not use one VPC as an intermediate to another and no overlapping CIDR blocks (check picture)

[[./images/vpc-peering.png][vpc-peering]]

*** Route Tables
Used to determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet must be associated with a route-table
of note a record of 0.0.0.0/0 grants public access to everything from anywhere

*** Internet Gateway (IGW)
Does the following:
1. provides a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic (inside/outside)
2. proivdes Network Address Translation (NAT) for instances which have been assigned public ipv4 traffic

#+attr_html: :alt  :align left :class img :width 500px

*** Bastion/Jumpbox
Bastions are security hardened EC2 instances designed to help you gain access to your EC2 instance in a private subnet.

[[./images/vpc-bastion.png][bastion EC2 instance]]

**** Modern architecture relies on Session Manager
Only requires an IAM policy attached to the role/user
#+begin_src bash options
aws --profile <your-profile> ssm start-session --target i-<ec2-ID>
#+end_src bash
#+attr_html: :alt  :align left :class img :width 500px
#+caption: SSM architecture
[[./images/vpc-session-manager.png][SSM]]
A working example can be found [[https://medium.com/canisworks/aws-systems-manager-vs-bastion-hosts-for-private-networks-efe9a42f5ad7][here]].

*** Direct Connect
AWS solution to establishing dedicated network between on-premises (offices/home) and AWS. This is not the same

*** VPC Endpoints
Allows you to privately connect your VPC to other AWS services without leaving the AWS network.
Eliminates the need for Internet Gateway, NAT device, VPN connection
2 types:
**** interface endpoints
Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) with a private IP addess. Thye ve as an entry point for traffic going to a supported service. Check AWS PrivateLink. Pay per GB tx
Wide applications (EC2 API)
**** Gateway endpoints
Is a gateway that is a targetfor a specific route in your route table. Free
Only supports S3 and DynamoDB

*** VPC Flowlogs
Allows for the capture of IP traffic information in-and-out of network interfaces within your VPC. Data is stored in CloudWatch logs.
Flow logs can be created for:
- VPC
- Subnets
- Network Interface
Always store the source and destination ip address (exam question)
