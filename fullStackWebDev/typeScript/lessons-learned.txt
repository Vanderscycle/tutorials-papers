remember that typeScript is a compiled languages and so you must recompile the file for the changes to take effect
Typescripts core types
number: no floats or ints (1.5 or 10 are considered the same)
string: all text values
boolean: true, false

JS has two type of equality (strict ===/ !==) and loose (== / !=)
=== compares both the type and value of the arguments
== compares only the value in a common type (will coerce them if not similar)
javascript is dynamically typed while typsecript (run-time) is statiscally typed (compile time)

let variable
const (think of tupple)
