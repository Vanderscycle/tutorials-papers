This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It's based on the official one from https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

This one has been pre-setup with TypeScript and Jest testing support.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

npx degit dceddia/svelte-typescript-jest svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```
