ben awad has an npm package that he uses for default config (npx tsconfig.json)

list all installed packages 
npm list -g --depth=0

to save a package use either flag -g or --save-dev 

if you want to use node
npm add ts-node --save-dev
in config     "start": "ts-node src/index.ts"
npm start (in console)

better way
{
    "dev": "nodemon dist/index.js",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",

}
npm add nodemon --save-dev
npm run watch (will create dist inside that you can use by calling node)
npm run start ( looks inside our package.json and execute)
npm run dev ( automatical refresh)
Because we code in TS we need to have it compiled into JS to run. Since we have npm run watch it will recompile the code whenever there is a change. which allows npm run dev to print in the terminal the changes.
