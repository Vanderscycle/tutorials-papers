## lessons learned

Quick refresher on docker

start command (assuming you have the image)

sudo docker run -it -v mongodata:/data/db --name mongodb -d mongo 
-v (volume) with local data being stored in mongodata 
if you want to bind a port add -p {local port}:{container port} (you can bind an ip:port address to a container port as well)

### NestJs

Enabling fastify
[quick start guide](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/performance#performance-fastify)
```
npm i --save @nestjs/platform-fastify
```
Since fastify is now the HTTP provider its important to use [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/) equivalent packages.
